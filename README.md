# GutenDext
This project uses the public online book database which contains several copyright-free published novels from around the world to employ the books into a type-practicing web application. The web application will allow users to type the entirety of a book based on the texts imported from the public GutenBerg API, GutenDex (http://gutendex.com/). Project GutenBerg is a free public website that users can go for free ebooks from the public domain. This web application will make a fetch request for users' search of a book within the database for them to type. Each users will be allowed to register and login to their account using the Google Identity service, and their accounts will keep track of their completed books, unfinished books, average typing speed, and accuracy. Users do not have to login to start their typing, but the web application will not be responsible for keeping track of their progress or data.
